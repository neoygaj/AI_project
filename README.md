# AI Vision-Based Reinforcement Learning Project

This project explores vision-based reinforcement learning using OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium environments, focused on training AI agents to interact with complex visual environments like Atari games.

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to:
- Train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent using visual inputs.
- Apply CNN-based models (e.g., DQN, PPO, or custom architectures).
- Evaluate performance in environments with continuous states or visual data.
- Utilize PyTorch, TensorBoard, and OpenAI Gymnasium.

## 🧠 Algorithms

Planned or implemented:
- Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Custom CNN encoder for vision-based states

## 🕹️ Environment

Target environments:
- `BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4` (Atari)
- `PongNoFrameskip-v4`
- Additional vision-heavy Gymnasium environments TBD

## 🛠️ Installation

### Create and activate virtual environment
```bash
conda create -n vision_rl python=3.10
conda activate vision_rl
